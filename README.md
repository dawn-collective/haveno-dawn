## About Haveno-dawn

Dawn is a collective dedicated to the principles of anonymity, autonomy, and decentralization. We envision a society free from censorship, corporate overreach, and government control, where technology serves all equally.

Decentralization is not just an idea, it is an ideal to be actively pursued. Our mission is to give back control to the individual, starting with financial sovereignty.

Haveno is an open-source, decentralized exchange platform built around Monero as a base currency, with networks hosted and maintained by the community. Our network, Haveno-dawn, is an independent instance of Haveno hosted by the collective. By launching Haveno-dawn, we aim to build trust and strengthen the resilience of the Monero ecosystem, ensuring that no single network becomes a point of failure or control.

> This is not the main Haveno repository. For information on the core Haveno project, please visit haveno-dex/haveno.
